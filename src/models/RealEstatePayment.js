        <h2 className='w-[695.9px] text-[25.4px] underline font-bold'>How much do you pay real estate agents?</h2>
        <p className='w-[806.8px] text-[14.1px]'>
            The cost of a real estate agent for rentals can vary based on factors such as location, market norms, and the specific services offered. Typically, you can expect to pay around one month’s rent or a percentage of one year’s rent. So if you rent an apartment in Tallahassee for $2,000 a month, you could pay anywhere between $2,000 to $2,400 if the agent takes 10% of the annual rent. However, practices can differ from region to region, so clarifying the terms and fees with the agent before entering into any agreements is essential. Consulting with the agent or agency upfront will help you understand the cost structure and any potential fees associated with their services in your market.

        <h2 className='w-[695.9px] text-[25.4px]'>Where can you find a real estate agent that works with rentals?</h2>
        <p className='w-[806.8px] text-[14.1px]'>
            You can find agents through various channels. A common approach is to search on reputable real estate agency websites, where agents often list their specialties and contact information. Additionally, requesting recommendations from friends, family, or colleagues who have recently rented properties can yield reliable referrals. Ultimately, online research, word-of-mouth referrals, and attending local events can help you find an excellent real estate agent to assist you in your apartment or home search.
